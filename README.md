# Statistical Models for data Science 

Here we have R code and jupyter notebook data exploration regarding both:  
1. Time Travel Dataset 
2. Lisa DeBerk Trial.  

> Note: the notebooks contain only some preliminary exploration and are not in a submitable state. 

### Setup:
I used `radian` version `0.6.15`.
The lockfile: `renv.lock`  has the latest snapshot of my `renv` environment.


**Files**: 
- `Report.Rmd` - The final markdown file used to render report on both studies.
- `Report.pdf` - The rendered report.
Generated by running: 
  ```R
  rmarkdown::render("Report.Rmd", output_
      format = "pdf_document", quiet = TRUE)
  ```
- `study1.R` - Contains the timetravel data original source code.
- `deberk.R` - Contains the Lisa DeBerk Trial original source code.
- Preliminary data exploration with Jupyter Notebooks - `study1_explore.ipynb` and `deberk_explore.ipynb`
